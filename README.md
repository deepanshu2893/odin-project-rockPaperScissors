# odin-project-rockPaperScissors

This is the 3rd Project from the Foundation Course of The Odin Project. 

What is it?

It is a simple Rock, Paper and Scissors game in which the player chooses either of the options and then the choice is compared to a randomly generated Computer Player choice. If the player wins, his score increases, if the computer wins, it's score increases. Give it a try!
